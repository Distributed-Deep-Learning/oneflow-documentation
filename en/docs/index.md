# OneFlow New Generation Deep Learning Framework

## What is OneFlow
OneFlow is an open source, using new frame design and the world's leading deep learning framework.

## Why we choose OneFlow

* New experience of distributed training. Make multi-machines and multi-cards sample as solo card.

* Perfect fit one-stop platform(k8s + docker)

* Support super scale model.

* Zero cost when running and linear acceleration

* Flexible support for multiple deep learning compiler

* Automatic Mixed Precision

* Neutral aspects and wide cooperation

* Keep improve operator set, model library

We are trying to build a meet all imagine of deep learning framework developers. We expected the trial, feedback and cooperation from all developers.

## Where to start

We can learn how to install and quick use of OneFlow in [quick start](build_ship/install.md).

In [basic topics](basics_topics/data_input.md), we will introduce how to use OneFlow to finish the common task of machine learning. Such as, how to build network, configuration of parameter, loading data and distributed training.

在[扩展专题](extended_topics/job_function_define_call.md)中我们介绍了具有 OneFlow 自身特点的话题，如 OneFlow 数据集格式、OneFlow 的并行观、开发者如何使用 VS Code 调试 OneFlow 框架等。

[高级应用实例](adv_examples/resnet.md)中的文章，对应了[OneFlow Model Zoo 仓库](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark)中的各个模型介绍，有助与读者理解模型脚本及相关细节。

最后，期待广大开发者、机器学习爱好者参与 [OneFlow 开源计划](contribute/intro.md)，共创、共享，一起打造迈向完美的深度学习框架。
