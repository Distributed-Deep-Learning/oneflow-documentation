# OneFlow New Generation Deep Learning Framework

## What is OneFlow
OneFlow is an open source, using new frame design and the world's leading deep learning framework.

## Why we choose OneFlow

* New experience of distributed training. Make multi-machines and multi-cards sample as solo card.

* Perfect fit one-stop platform(k8s + docker)

* Support super scale model.

* Zero cost when running and linear acceleration

* Flexible support for multiple deep learning compiler

* Automatic Mixed Precision

* Neutral aspects and wide cooperation

* Keep improve operator set, model library

We are trying to build a meet all imagine of deep learning framework developers. We expected the trial, feedback and cooperation from all developers.

## Where to start

We can learn how to install and quick use of OneFlow in [quick start](build_ship/install.md).

In [basic topics](basics_topics/data_input.md), we will introduce how to use OneFlow to finish the common task of machine learning. Such as, how to build network, configuration of parameter, loading data and distributed training.

In [extend topic](extended_topics/job_function_define_call.md). We introduce the characteristics of OneFlow. Such as, the format of OneFlow's data set, parallel strategy of OneFlow and how can developers use VS code to debugging OneFlow framework.

In[ advance examples](adv_examples/resnet.md), we introduce each model in [OneFlow Model Zoo repository](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark). It is helpful for user to understand the models and other details.

Finally, we expecting all developers and all machine learning fans to participate in [OneFlow open sources project](contribute/intro.md). Creating and sharing. Build the perfect deep learning frame work together.
